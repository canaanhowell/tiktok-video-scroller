// Simple fix to test if videos will play without complex HLS logic

const testFix = `
The issue is that the HLS fragment loading logic is too complex and videos get stuck waiting for the "perfect" quality level.

Quick fix to try:
1. Remove the FRAG_LOADED event handler complexity
2. Just play the video after HLS manifest is loaded
3. Let HLS.js handle quality switching automatically

The current code waits for:
- High quality fragment to load
- Specific quality levels
- Complex state management

But this is causing videos to never start playing.
