# Debug TikTok-Like Video Scroller: Video Loading Issues

## Context
I'm building a TikTok-style vertical video scroller web app that's currently deployed on Vercel. The app is live but **videos are not loading properly**. I need to systematically debug and fix the video loading issues to ensure smooth playback and user experience.

## Current Status
- ✅ App is deployed and accessible on Vercel
- ✅ Frontend interface is rendering correctly
- ❌ Videos are failing to load/play properly
- ❌ Video playback experience is broken

## Debugging Requirements

### 1. **Comprehensive Video Loading Diagnostics**
Please help me implement thorough debugging to identify why videos aren't loading:

#### Network & CDN Analysis
- Check if video URLs are accessible and returning proper responses
- Verify CORS headers are configured correctly for video resources
- Test video file formats and ensure browser compatibility
- Validate CDN/hosting service configuration and accessibility
- Check for any geographic restrictions or access limitations

#### Browser Compatibility Testing
- Test video loading across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Check for browser-specific video codec support issues
- Verify HTML5 video element implementation
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices

#### Performance Analysis
- Measure video loading times and identify bottlenecks
- Check for memory leaks or performance issues during video playback
- Analyze network waterfall to identify slow/failing requests
- Monitor browser performance during video loading

### 2. **Implement Comprehensive Logging System**

#### Frontend Logging Strategy
```javascript
// Example logging structure - implement similar comprehensive logging
const VideoLogger = {
  logVideoLoadStart: (videoId, videoUrl) => {
    console.log(`[VIDEO_LOAD_START] ID: ${videoId}, URL: ${videoUrl}, Timestamp: ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
  },
  logVideoLoadSuccess: (videoId, loadTime) => {
    console.log(`[VIDEO_LOAD_SUCCESS] ID: ${videoId}, Load Time: ${loadTime}ms`);
  },
  logVideoLoadError: (videoId, error) => {
    console.error(`[VIDEO_LOAD_ERROR] ID: ${videoId}, Error: ${error.message}, Stack: ${error.stack}`);
  }
};
```

#### Error Tracking Implementation
- Add detailed error logging for video loading failures
- Log network request failures with full error details
- Track user actions that trigger video loading issues
- Monitor browser console for JavaScript errors related to video playback
- Implement error boundaries around video components

#### Performance Logging
- Log video loading times and buffering events
- Track memory usage during video playback
- Monitor frame drops and playback quality issues
- Log network conditions and their impact on video loading

### 3. **Video Loading Best Practices Implementation**

#### Preloading Strategy
- Implement proper video preloading (metadata, auto, none)
- Add loading states and skeleton screens during video load
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Implement retry logic for failed video loads

#### Error Handling & Fallbacks
- Add comprehensive error handling for video loading failures
- Implement fallback video sources or placeholder content
- Show user-friendly error messages instead of broken video elements
- Add manual retry options for failed video loads

#### Progressive Enhancement
- Ensure basic functionality works without JavaScript
- Implement graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Add accessibility features for video content
- Optimize for various network conditions

## Debugging Process Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Diagnosis
1. **Console Analysis**: Check browser developer tools for any JavaScript errors
2. **Network Tab Review**: Analyze all video-related network requests and responses
3. **Video Element Inspection**: Verify HTML5 video element properties and states
4. **CORS Verification**: Ensure video resources are accessible from the Vercel domain

### Phase 2: Systematic Testing
1. **Single Video Test**: Isolate and test one video loading independently
2. **Multiple Video Test**: Test the video scroller with multiple videos
3. **Device Testing**: Test across different devices and screen sizes
4. **Network Testing**: Test under various network conditions (slow 3G, fast WiFi)

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
1. **Loading Optimization**: Implement efficient video preloading strategies
2. **Memory Management**: Ensure proper cleanup of video elements
3. **Error Recovery**: Add robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **User Experience**: Enhance loading states and error messaging

## Expected Debugging Output

Please provide:

### 1. **Detailed Error Analysis**
- Specific error messages and codes
- Stack traces for JavaScript errors
- Network request failure details
- Browser compatibility issues identified

### 2. **Root Cause Identification**
- Primary reason videos aren't loading
- Secondary contributing factors
- Environment-specific issues (Vercel deployment, CDN configuration)

### 3. **Step-by-Step Fix Plan**
- Prioritized list of issues to address
- Code changes needed for each fix
- Testing strategy for each solution
- Rollback plan if fixes cause new issues

### 4. **Preventive Measures**
- Monitoring systems to catch future video loading issues
- Automated testing for video functionality
- Performance benchmarks for video loading
- Error alerting for production video failures

## Best Practices Reminders

### Logging Standards
- **Always use structured logging** with consistent formats and levels
- **Include context**: user ID, session ID, video ID, timestamp, browser info
- **Log the complete user journey**: from video request to successful playback
- **Never log sensitive data**: avoid logging user credentials or personal information
- **Use log levels appropriately**: ERROR for failures, WARN for degraded performance, INFO for normal operations, DEBUG for detailed troubleshooting

### Error Handling
- **Catch and log all exceptions** with full context and stack traces
- **Implement graceful degradation** when video loading fails
- **Provide actionable error messages** to users
- **Track error patterns** to identify systemic issues

### Performance Monitoring
- **Log performance metrics** like load times, buffer health, and frame rates
- **Monitor resource usage** including memory and network bandwidth
- **Track user experience metrics** like time to first frame and rebuffering events
- **Set up alerts** for performance degradation

### Production Debugging
- **Use production-safe logging** that doesn't impact performance
- **Implement feature flags** for debugging features that can be toggled in production
- **Store logs centrally** for analysis across multiple Vercel deployments
- **Include deployment context** in logs (commit hash, deployment time, environment)

## Success Criteria
- Videos load consistently across all supported browsers and devices
- Loading times are optimized for good user experience
- Comprehensive error handling prevents app crashes
- Detailed logging provides clear visibility into video loading performance
- User experience is smooth and TikTok-like in responsiveness

Please analyze the current video loading implementation, identify all issues, and provide a comprehensive fix with proper logging and error handling.
