# Bunny CDN Video Issue - Fix Summary

## Issue
Production site at media.synthetikmedia.ai is showing stock/demo videos instead of the Bunny CDN videos from the input folder.

## Root Cause
The latest code with Bunny CDN integration has been pushed to GitHub, but the production deployment may not have the latest changes.

## Current State
1. **Bunny CDN Videos**: Successfully uploaded and accessible
   - Video 1: `724695ee-95f8-4a97-8558-ec4d384613e3`
   - Video 2: `73057fa4-bc39-492c-a69f-814503efa047`
   - Video 4: `0c186e2d-1c2b-44bc-a37b-f1b40db2ef35`
   - Video 5: `72118581-c1e7-4e79-8e10-f47c95531b05`

2. **Code Status**: 
   - `src/app/page.tsx` has hardcoded Bunny CDN videos
   - API route exists at `src/app/api/videos/list/route.ts`
   - All changes pushed to GitHub

## Solution Steps

### 1. Verify Vercel Deployment
Check the Vercel dashboard to ensure:
- The latest deployment from GitHub has completed
- Environment variables are set:
  - `bunny_cdn_streaming_library`
  - `bunny_cdn_streaming_key`
  - `bunny_cdn_streaming_hostname`

### 2. Force Redeploy if Needed
If the deployment hasn't triggered:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest commit
4. Ensure "Use existing Build Cache" is UNCHECKED

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
In Vercel project settings > Environment Variables:
```
bunny_cdn_streaming_library=467029
bunny_cdn_streaming_key=[your-api-key]
bunny_cdn_streaming_hostname=vz-97606b97-31d.b-cdn.net
```

### 4. Test After Deployment
Once deployed, the site should show:
- Videos from the input folder
- Working API at `/api/videos/list`
- No more stock/demo videos

## Quick Test
Visit: https://media.synthetikmedia.ai
You should see "Video 1 from input folder ðŸŽ¥" and similar descriptions.
