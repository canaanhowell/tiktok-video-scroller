Ultimate TikTok-Like Video Scroller: Technical Requirements Guide (Redis + Bunny CDN Enhanced)
Hyper-Optimized Video Delivery Architecture
Bunny CDN + Redis Integration Strategy
Create a intelligent CDN routing system using Redis to track Bunny CDN edge performance in real-time. Store latency metrics, availability status, and bandwidth capabilities for each Bunny edge location. Route users to the fastest performing edge based on their geographic location and current network conditions stored in Redis.
Multi-Quality Adaptive Streaming
Leverage Bunny's video optimization APIs with Redis caching of transcoded video variants. Store video quality ladders (240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) metadata in Redis for instant quality switching decisions. Use Redis to cache user's device capabilities and network speed history to predict optimal starting quality.
Smart Video Segment Caching
Use Redis to cache the first 3-5 seconds of videos as compressed byte arrays for instant playback start. Store video segments from Bunny CDN in Redis with TTL based on video popularity. Implement "hot video" detection using Redis counters that automatically cache full videos when they hit viral thresholds.
Advanced Content Delivery & Performance
Predictive CDN Warming
Use Redis analytics to identify trending content before it goes viral. Automatically push predicted viral content to Bunny CDN edge locations closest to the target demographic. Store video popularity trajectories in Redis time series to predict which content needs global distribution.
Dynamic Bitrate Optimization
Combine Bunny's adaptive bitrate with Redis-stored user network patterns. Cache user's historical bandwidth performance and device capabilities in Redis. Use this data to start videos at optimal quality immediately, avoiding the typical quality ramp-up period.
Intelligent Video Preprocessing
Use Redis job queues to manage Bunny CDN video processing workflows. Store processing status, generate thumbnails, extract video previews, and create multiple format variants. Cache processing results in Redis for instant availability checks.
Real-Time Performance Optimization
Edge Location Intelligence
Store real-time performance metrics for each Bunny CDN edge in Redis. Track response times, error rates, and bandwidth availability. Implement automatic failover to secondary edges when performance degrades, with decisions made in milliseconds using Redis data.
Network Condition Adaptation
Use Redis to store user's real-time network quality assessments. Automatically switch between Bunny CDN zones (premium vs. standard) based on user's connection quality and subscription tier. Cache network condition changes to predict when to preload higher/lower quality variants.
Geographic Content Distribution
Leverage Redis geospatial data structures to map users to optimal Bunny CDN zones. Store content popularity by geographic region and automatically distribute trending regional content to appropriate edge locations.
Advanced Caching & Memory Management
Multi-Layer Content Cache
Implement a sophisticated caching hierarchy:

L1 Cache (Redis): Video metadata, thumbnails, first 5 seconds of trending videos
L2 Cache (Bunny CDN): Full videos, multiple quality variants
L3 Cache (Origin): Raw uploads, archival content

Use Redis to orchestrate cache invalidation across all layers when content updates.
Smart Cache Preloading
Use Redis pub/sub to coordinate cache warming across app instances. When a video starts trending in one region, automatically cache it in Redis instances serving similar demographics globally. Implement cache prediction algorithms that preload content based on user behavior patterns.
Memory-Efficient Video Handling
Store video segment maps in Redis that point to specific Bunny CDN URLs for each quality level. Implement progressive loading where Redis serves instant metadata while Bunny streams the actual video content. Use Redis to manage video buffer states across the user's feed.
Real-Time Analytics & Optimization
Live Performance Monitoring
Use Redis streams to capture real-time video performance metrics from Bunny CDN. Track metrics like:

Time to first byte from each edge location
Video start time across different qualities
Buffer health and rebuffering events
User engagement correlated with delivery performance

Dynamic Content Routing
Implement intelligent routing decisions using Redis-stored performance data. Route premium users to Bunny's highest-tier edges, while optimizing costs for free users. Use Redis to A/B test different CDN configurations and measure impact on engagement.
Viral Content Detection
Use Redis to implement real-time viral detection algorithms. Track engagement velocity, sharing patterns, and view acceleration. Automatically trigger Bunny CDN global distribution when content hits viral thresholds, ensuring worldwide availability before the traffic spike hits.
Advanced User Experience Features
Zero-Latency Video Starts
Combine Redis caching with Bunny's low-latency streaming. Cache video keyframes in Redis for instant thumbnail generation. Store audio waveforms for videos to enable sound-based recommendations. Pre-cache video previews (first 2-3 seconds) in Redis for immediate playback.
Intelligent Preloading Strategy
Use Redis to analyze user scroll patterns and preload content from Bunny CDN accordingly. For fast scrollers, preload only thumbnails and metadata. For engaged viewers, aggressively preload full videos. Store user behavior profiles in Redis to optimize preloading strategies per user type.
Network-Aware Quality Switching
Implement seamless quality transitions using Redis to coordinate between multiple Bunny CDN streams. Store user's quality preferences and network capabilities in Redis. Switch between CDN zones and quality levels without interrupting playback.
Cost Optimization & Efficiency
Smart Bandwidth Management
Use Redis to track Bunny CDN bandwidth usage in real-time and implement dynamic cost optimization. Route users to different CDN zones based on their subscription tier and current bandwidth costs. Cache popular content in Redis to reduce CDN requests during peak hours.
Regional Content Strategy
Leverage Redis geospatial features to optimize Bunny CDN regional distribution. Store content popularity by region and automatically adjust CDN caching strategies. Implement region-specific quality defaults based on average network conditions stored in Redis.
Predictive Scaling
Use Redis time series data to predict traffic spikes and pre-scale Bunny CDN resources. Store historical usage patterns and automatically trigger CDN optimization before anticipated high-traffic events.
Technical Implementation Considerations
Failover & Redundancy
Implement Redis cluster failover that seamlessly switches CDN routing logic. Store backup CDN configurations in Redis for instant failover when Bunny CDN experiences issues. Use Redis sentinel for automatic failover coordination.
Real-Time Configuration Updates
Use Redis pub/sub to push CDN configuration changes to all app instances instantly. Update quality thresholds, edge routing rules, and caching policies without app restarts. Store feature flags in Redis for instant A/B test configuration changes.
Global State Synchronization
Synchronize video engagement data across Redis instances globally to ensure consistent recommendation algorithms worldwide. Use Redis streams for cross-region data replication of trending content and user engagement patterns.
This architecture leverages Redis as the intelligent orchestration layer and Bunny CDN as the high-performance content delivery mechanism, creating a video experience that can rival or exceed TikTok's performance while maintaining cost efficiency and global scalability.
