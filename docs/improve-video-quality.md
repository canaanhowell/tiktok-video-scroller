# ðŸŽ¥ Improving Video Quality on Bunny CDN

## Current Issue
Your videos are being transcoded by Bunny CDN with default settings, resulting in lower quality than the original 1080x1080 @ 6.4 Mbps videos.

## Quick Fixes Applied âœ…
1. **Updated HLS Player Configuration** - Forces highest available quality
   - Set higher bandwidth estimates (5 Mbps)
   - Removed quality capping
   - Prioritizes quality over loading speed

## Manual Bunny CDN Settings to Change ðŸ”§

### 1. Access Bunny Stream Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dash.bunny.net/stream
2. Select your library (ID: 467029)
3. Click on "Stream Settings"

### 2. Update Video Processing Settings
In the Stream Settings, change these options:

**Resolution & Quality:**
- âœ… Enable **1080p** encoding
- âœ… Enable **Original Quality** preservation
- âœ… Set Bitrate to **"High"** or **"Custom"** (6000-8000 kbps)
- âœ… Enable **"Keep Original Files"** option

**Encoding Profile:**
- Change from "Optimized for streaming" to **"High Quality"**
- Or use **"Custom"** with these settings:
  - Video Codec: H.264
  - Profile: High
  - Bitrate: 6000-8000 kbps
  - Keyframe Interval: 2 seconds

### 3. Re-upload Videos (Optional)
If quality doesn't improve with player updates:
```bash
# Re-upload with better settings
node scripts/upload-input-videos.js --force-quality
```

## Alternative Solutions ðŸš€

### Option 1: Direct MP4 Playback
Instead of HLS streaming, use direct MP4 URLs for better quality:
```javascript
// In your video configuration
const videoUrl = `https://vz-97606b97-31d.b-cdn.net/${videoId}/play_720p.mp4`
```

### Option 2: Use Bunny CDN's Direct Play
Enable "Direct Play" in Bunny Stream settings for original quality playback.

### Option 3: Custom Transcoding Profiles
Create a custom transcoding profile in Bunny CDN:
1. Go to Stream Settings â†’ Transcoding Profiles
2. Create new profile with:
   - 1080p @ 6000 kbps
   - 720p @ 3000 kbps
   - 480p @ 1500 kbps

## Verification Steps ðŸ“Š
1. Clear browser cache
2. Visit https://media.synthetikmedia.ai
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for: "Setting quality to highest level: X"
5. Check Network tab for video segment bitrates

## Expected Results
- Videos should play at 1080p resolution
- Bitrate should be 4-6 Mbps (instead of default 1-2 Mbps)
- No pixelation or compression artifacts
