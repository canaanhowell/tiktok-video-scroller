# Chat History Log - July 20, 2025

## Session Overview
This session continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The session focused on UI/UX improvements, navigation updates, and fixing issues with the TikTok-style video scroller application.

## Chronological Task Summary

### 1. Initial Context - Dual Button Implementation (Reverted)
**User Request**: "duplicate the 'Explore Vendor' button and change the new one to 'Explore Music' and center them side by side with the music button using secondary color"

**Actions Taken**:
- Located the Explore Vendor button in `/src/components/video/VideoScrollerFresh.tsx`
- Created dual button layout with Explore Vendor (yellow) and Explore Music (grey #dadde2)
- Implemented responsive sizing for mobile
- Made buttons wider (95px → 120px → 150px) to prevent text wrapping
- Fixed centering issues with `left-0 right-0` and `justify-center`

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/video/VideoScrollerFresh.tsx` - Added dual button logic

**Result**: User later requested to revert to single button

### 2. Revert to Single Button
**User Request**: "comment the dual button logic out for now, and lets go back to a single 'Explore Vendor' button"

**Actions Taken**:
- Commented out dual button implementation
- Restored original single centered Explore Vendor button
- Preserved dual button code for potential future use

**Commit**: "Revert to single Explore Vendor button"

### 3. Logo Replacement and Sizing
**User Request**: "replace the current logo on desktop with the logo png here: web_app\assets\logo\true_harmonic_logo_transparent.png"

**Actions Taken**:
- Replaced text logo with PNG image in DesktopNav
- Copied logo from assets to public directory: `/public/assets/logo/`
- Initially set height to 240px (tripled from original 80px)
- Added cache busting with `?v=${Date.now()}` when user reported logo not updating
- Progressively reduced size: 240px → 120px → 80px per user requests
- Maintained aspect ratio with `w-auto`

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/layout/DesktopNav.tsx` - Logo implementation
- `/public/assets/logo/true_harmonic_logo_transparent.png` - Logo file

**Container Adjustments**:
- h-16 → h-64 → h-32 → h-24 (final)
- Logo height: 40px → 240px → 120px → 80px (final)

### 4. New Category Additions
**User Request**: "add the following categories to the category section: florists, wedding cakes"

**Actions Taken**:
1. Updated navigation arrays in both desktop and mobile nav
2. Added Lucide icons: Flower2 for Florists, Cake for Wedding Cakes
3. Created new page components:
   - `/src/app/florists/page.tsx`
   - `/src/app/wedding-cakes/page.tsx`
4. Updated TypeScript types in categoryLibraries.ts
5. Added category library configurations (initially with placeholder values)

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/layout/DesktopNav.tsx` - Added new nav items
- `/src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx` - Added new nav items
- `/src/config/categoryLibraries.ts` - Added florists and wedding-cakes configurations

### 5. Unmute Reminder Styling
**User Request**: "change the 'unmute' reminder on page load to opacity 50% and move it top right of screen"

**Actions Taken**:
1. Located unmute indicator in VideoScrollerFresh.tsx
2. Changed opacity from 70% to 50% (`bg-opacity-70` → `bg-opacity-50`)
3. Moved position: center → top-right → top-10% → back to center
4. Final position: centered with 50% opacity

**Position Changes**:
- Original: `top-1/2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`
- Attempted: `top-4 right-4` → `top-[10%] right-4`
- Final: Back to original center position with reduced opacity

### 6. Environment Variable Updates
**User Request**: "ive updated the bunny cdn .env section to include florists and wedding cakes, make sure the link mapping is updated"

**Actions Taken**:
- Removed hardcoded default library IDs for florists and wedding-cakes
- Updated to use proper environment variables:
  - `bunny_cdn_video_streaming_library_florists_9x16` (and related)
  - `bunny_cdn_video_streaming_library_wedding_cakes_9x16` (and related)
- Changed defaults from specific IDs to empty strings

**Commit**: "Update Florists and Wedding Cakes to use proper env variables"

### 7. Git Push Configuration
**User Request**: "push and commit" then "use github cli" then "the git credentials are in .env"

**Actions Taken**:
1. Discovered 28 commits ahead of origin/main
2. Found credentials in .env:
   - GITHUB_USERNAME=canaanhowell
   - GITHUB_PAT=[personal access token]
   - GITHUB_REPO=tiktok-video-scroller
3. Configured git and pushed using PAT authentication
4. Created `GIT_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive instructions

**Files Created**:
- `/GIT_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide for git operations with .env credentials

## Technical Details and Patterns

### Component Structure
- **Desktop Navigation**: `/src/components/layout/DesktopNav.tsx`
  - Uses Lucide React icons
  - Responsive sizing with CSS variables
  - Three sections: Logo, Categories, Bottom items (Saved, Vendor HQ, Settings)
  
- **Mobile Navigation**: `/src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx`
  - Bottom navigation with 4 items
  - Pop-up category menu with 80% opacity
  - Vendor categories array matching desktop

### Video Components
- **VideoScrollerFresh**: Main video display component
  - Handles mute/unmute state with `globalUnmuted` flag
  - Shows category overlay and vendor buttons
  - Device-specific rendering (mobile vs desktop)

### Configuration Files
- **categoryLibraries.ts**: Maps categories to Bunny CDN libraries
  - Supports mobile (9:16) and desktop (16:9) aspect ratios
  - Each category has libraryId, hostname, and apiKey
  - Uses environment variables with trim() for safety

### Styling Patterns
- Tailwind CSS throughout
- Opacity variations: 50%, 70%, 80%, 95%
- Responsive classes: `md:` prefix for desktop
- Color system: Primary (white), Secondary (#dadde2), Accent (#f4c82d)

## Environment Variables Structure
```
# Bunny CDN - Default Libraries
bunny_cdn_video_streaming_library_9x16=
bunny_cdn_video_streaming_hostname_9x16=
bunny_cdn_video_streaming_key_9x16=
bunny_cdn_video_streaming_library_16x9=
bunny_cdn_video_streaming_hostname_16x9=
bunny_cdn_video_streaming_key_16x9=

# Category-specific libraries follow same pattern:
# _library_[category]_[aspect]
# _hostname_[category]_[aspect]
# _key_[category]_[aspect]
```

## Current State
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Deployed to Vercel
- 8 vendor categories: Popular, Venues, Photographers, Videographers, Musicians, DJs, Florists, Wedding Cakes
- Logo updated and properly sized
- Single Explore Vendor button (dual button code commented out)
- Unmute reminder centered with 50% opacity

## Key Decisions Made
1. Reverted dual button design to single button
2. Logo sized to 80px height (1/3 of initial attempt)
3. Unmute reminder kept centered rather than corner placement
4. Used environment variables exclusively for new categories
5. Created comprehensive git guide for future operations

## Deployment Information
- Platform: Vercel
- Latest deployment: https://tiktok-video-scroller-hzv8p3tp1-canaan-howells-projects.vercel.app
- Git repository: https://github.com/canaanhowell/tiktok-video-scroller
- All changes successfully deployed and pushed

## Notes for Next Agent
1. Dual button code is commented out in VideoScrollerFresh.tsx if needed
2. Git credentials are stored in .env - see GIT_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md
3. Logo uses cache busting to prevent stale images
4. All category pages use the shared CategoryVideoPage component
5. Device detection uses SSR default of 'desktop' to prevent race conditions
